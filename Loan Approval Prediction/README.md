# **Loan Approval Prediction**

## Overview:
A home loan, also known as a housing loan or a mortgage, is a type of loan provided by financial institutions, such as banks or housing finance companies, to help individuals or families purchase a house. Home loans are typically long-term loans, ranging from 5 to 30 years, and are secured by the property being purchased.

The loan amount and the interest rate offered by the lender will depend on various factors such as the borrower's income, credit score, employment history, the value of the property, and the down payment made by the borrower. Generally, borrowers are required to make a down payment of 10-20% of the property value and the lender provides the remaining amount as a loan.

When a borrower takes out a home loan, they are required to repay the loan amount along with interest over the loan tenure through monthly installments. Defaulting on home loan payments can lead to penalties and even foreclosure of the property by the lender.

Overall, home loans can help individuals and families achieve their dream of owning a home, but it is important to carefully consider the terms and conditions of the loan and ensure that the monthly repayments are affordable before committing to a loan.
